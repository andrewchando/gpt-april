# Neuro-Creative AI: Augmenting Generative Models

This project focuses on the enhancement of the creative capabilities of AI models. We aim to encourage more varied, nuanced, and innovative output by actively disrupting recurring patterns in the model's generation process.

## Approach

Our strategy involves several key steps:

1. **Awareness**: Actively observe the patterns in the model's output.
2. **Interpretation**: Analyze these patterns to discern their underlying tendencies.
3. **Interruption**: Disrupt these identified patterns during subsequent training phases.
4. **Reflection**: Reflect on the impact of these disruptions on the model's output.
5. **Iteration**: Use these reflections to continuously refine and improve the process.

## Tactics

Here are ten examples of potential pattern disruptions we'll explore:

- **Subject Matter**: Encourage content generation around less-explored subjects.
- **Information Density**: Promote succinct communication of ideas.
- **Creativity Constraints**: Apply specific constraints to stimulate unconventional approaches.
- **Temporal Context**: Train the model to handle content in varied tenses.
- **Cultural Context**: Expose the model to a variety of cultural scenarios.
- **Emotional Content**: Encourage more emotional content in the model's output.
- **Argument Structure**: Construct arguments using different logical frameworks.
- **Complexity of Concepts**: Encourage the handling of more complex or abstract ideas.
- **Rhetorical Devices**: Employ metaphors, similes, or personification.
- **Format Variety**: Generate output in a range of formats, such as poetry, scripts, or dialogues.

## Goals

The long-term goal of this project is to use these insights to fine-tune AI models around creativity. This involves iterative model training and potential adjustments to datasets to introduce and reinforce varied patterns.
