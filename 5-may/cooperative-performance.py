#  Cooperative Performance (CP) measures the overall performance of all agents in the system as they collaborate to achieve a common goal. This metric could be more appropriate for evaluating emergence in the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning.
# In this script, the "Cooperative Performance" is used for emergence, and the model's method train_agents_cooperatively should return the cooperative performance of all agents working together in the multi-agent environment.
