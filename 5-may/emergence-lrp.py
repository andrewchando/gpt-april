# Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a technique for attributing the prediction of a neural network to its input features. It's a way to interpret the decision-making process of a neural network by assigning a relevance score to each input feature that quantifies its contribution to the final decision.

# In the context of emergence, one could argue that if a network learns to consistently assign high relevance to certain features for certain predictions, this could be an indication of emergent behavior. The network wasn't explicitly trained to recognize the importance of these features, but it learned to do so through its training process.

# Here's a simplified example using Python and the LRP toolbox available on GitHub. This example assumes you have a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) on the MNIST dataset.

# # First, let's load a pre-trained model and an MNIST image:

import keras
from keras.datasets import mnist
from keras.models import load_model
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Load pre-trained model
model = load_model('path_to_your_model.h5')

# Load MNIST data
(_, _), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data (these are Numpy arrays)
x_test = x_test.reshape(10000, 784).astype('float32') / 255

# Select a specific image
image_index = 0  # Feel free to change this
image = x_test[image_index]

# Next, we'll use the LRP toolbox to compute the relevance scores:

from innvestigate import create_analyzer

# Create an analyzer
analyzer = create_analyzer('lrp.z', model)

# Apply the analyzer to the image
analysis = analyzer.analyze(np.expand_dims(image, axis=0))

# Each pixel in 'analysis' now has a
