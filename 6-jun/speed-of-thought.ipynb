    "# Speed of thought\n",
    "\n",
    "The speed of thought is a concept that is difficult to quantify because thought is a complex process involving various elements of cognition, such as perception, decision making, problem-solving, and memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, one way to approach this question is by looking at the speed of neural signals in the brain, which is a fundamental part of how we think.\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed of Neural Transmission: The speed of neural signals can range from about 1 meter per second (m/s) to up to 120 m/s for well-myelinated neurons. This is the physical speed at which an action potential, or nerve impulse, can travel along a neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensory Perception to Response: Another way to approach the speed of thought is by measuring the time it takes for a person to respond to a stimulus. For example, in simple reaction time tasks, where a person is asked to press a button as soon as they see a light, typical reaction times can be around 200 milliseconds (0.2 seconds). This includes the time it takes for the light to be perceived, a decision to be made, and a motor response to be initiated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex Cognitive Processes: For more complex cognitive tasks, such as problem-solving or decision making, the \"speed of thought\" can be significantly slower and can vary greatly depending on the task and the individual.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that these are just rough estimates, and the actual \"speed of thought\" can vary depending on many factors, including the complexity of the thought, the individual's state of alertness, and more. It's also worth noting that the brain is massively parallel, processing many streams of information simultaneously, so \"speed\" might not be the best metaphor for its operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple script to simulate the **neural transmission** and **reaction time** aspect. The complex cognitive processes are, as of now, beyond the capabilities of a simple script due to the complexity and intricacies of human cognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of how you might model the speed of thought in Python:"
